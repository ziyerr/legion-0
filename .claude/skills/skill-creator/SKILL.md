# Skill Creator

Help the user create a new skill by guiding them through these steps:

1. **Define the skill**: Ask what the skill should do, when it should trigger, and what tools it needs.
2. **Create the folder structure**: Create a folder in `~/.claude/skills/` with the skill name (kebab-case).
3. **Write SKILL.md**: Create the SKILL.md file with proper YAML frontmatter (name, description) and markdown instructions.
4. **Optional files**: Create scripts/, references/, or assets/ subdirectories if needed.

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
